Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video, or audio content. That hidden data is then extracted at its destination.

Content concealed through steganography is sometimes encrypted before being hidden within another file format. If it isn’t encrypted, then it may be processed in some way to make it harder to detect.

As a form of covert communication, steganography is sometimes compared to cryptography. However, the two are not the same since steganography does not involve scrambling data upon sending or using a key to decode it upon receipt. Steganography works by concealing information in a way that avoids suspicion. One of the most prevalent techniques is called ‘least significant bit’ (LSB) steganography. This involves embedding the secret information in the least significant bits of a media file. For example:

In an image file, each pixel is made up of three bytes of data corresponding to the colors red, green, and blue. Some image formats allocate an additional fourth byte to transparency, or ‘alpha’. LSB steganography alters the last bit of each of those bytes to hide one bit of data. So, to hide one megabyte of data using this method, you would need an eight-megabyte image file. Modifying the last bit of the pixel value doesn’t result in a visually perceptible change to the picture, which means that anyone viewing the original and the steganographically-modified images won’t be able to tell the difference.
